  41: `Kaka looks up at the night sky and dreams of the stars!
The stars twinkle like tiny diamonds scattered across black velvet. Kaka decides to build a rocket ship. With the help of all the friends from previous adventures, the rocket takes shape.
You typed the word rocket! Metal panels clicked into place. You typed the word build! Engines hummed with power.
The rocket ship stands tall and shiny. It is painted blue with yellow stars. The name "Friendship" is written on the side.
Exciting! Your rocket is ready for launch! Three, two, one, blast off!`,

  42: `The rocket ship launches into the sky!
Fire shoots from the engines. The ground shakes. Kaka watches Earth grow smaller through the window. Clouds pass by in a blur. Then suddenly, everything is quiet.
You typed the word space! The rocket entered the vast darkness. You typed the word float! Kaka started floating inside the cabin.
Stars surround the rocket in every direction. Earth looks like a beautiful blue marble far below. Kaka has never felt so free and light.
We are in space! The greatest adventure of all has begun!`,

  43: `The Moon appears in the window!
It is bigger than Kaka ever imagined. Gray mountains and deep craters cover the surface. The rocket lands softly in moon dust.
You typed the word moon! The landing gear touched down safely. You typed the word step! Kaka took the first step onto the surface.
Kaka bounces in low gravity. Each jump goes higher than the last! Footprints appear in the ancient dust. Kaka is a real astronaut now!
One small step for mouse, one giant leap for friendship!`,

  44: `Kaka meets Moon Mouse on the lunar surface!
Moon Mouse has sparkly silver fur. She has lived on the moon for many years. She is very happy to finally have a visitor.
You typed the word hello! Moon Mouse waved both paws. You typed the word friend! They touched noses in greeting.
Moon Mouse shows Kaka a secret cave filled with moon crystals. Each crystal glows with soft blue light. They are the most beautiful things Kaka has ever seen.
New friends are everywhere! Even on the moon!`,

  45: `The rocket travels to the red planet Mars!
Mars is covered in rusty red mountains and deep canyons. Dust storms swirl in the distance. The sky is a strange orange color.
You typed the word planet! Mars grew larger in the window. You typed the word land! The rocket touched down on red soil.
Kaka collects red rocks as souvenirs. The rocks sparkle with tiny crystals. Maybe someday many mice will live on Mars too!
Mars explorer! You discovered a whole new world!`,

  46: `Asteroids fill the space ahead like a giant obstacle course!
Rocks of all sizes spin and tumble through the void. The rocket must navigate carefully between them. One wrong move could be dangerous!
You typed the word careful! The rocket slowed down. You typed the word steer! The rocket weaved between the rocks.
Left, right, up, down! The rocket dances through the asteroid field. Kaka spots a beautiful crystal asteroid and waves as they pass.
Expert pilot! You navigated the asteroids perfectly!`,

  47: `A giant space station floats in orbit!
The station is shaped like a wheel, spinning slowly against the stars. Lights blink in every window. Creatures from many planets live and work here.
You typed the word station! The docking bay doors opened. You typed the word explore! Kaka floated into the main hall.
Scientists from across the galaxy study the stars here. They welcome Kaka and share their discoveries. Knowledge is the greatest treasure in space!
Welcome aboard! The space station is amazing!`,

  48: `Alien friends need help fixing their ship!
Their ship broke down near the space station. They look different from mice but their smiles are just the same. They need special parts to fly home.
You typed the word help! Kaka gathered the needed parts. You typed the word fix! The alien ship started humming again.
The aliens thank Kaka with a special gift: a star map showing secrets of the universe. Friends help friends, no matter how different they look.
Friendship crosses galaxies! The aliens will never forget you!`,

  49: `A beautiful meteor shower fills the sky!
Shooting stars streak across the darkness. Each one leaves a trail of sparkling dust. Kaka makes a wish on every single star.
You typed the word star! The meteors glowed even brighter. You typed the word wish! All your wishes floated into space.
Kaka watches the show through the rocket window. The universe is so big and beautiful. Every star might have friends Kaka has not met yet.
Make a wish! Dreams can come true among the stars!`,

  50: `Time to fly home to Earth!
Kaka has traveled so far and learned so much. From the Cheese Factory to the Green Garden, the Blue Ocean, Candy Land, and through outer space. Every adventure made Kaka stronger.
You typed every word on this journey! You learned letters, then words, then sentences. You never gave up!
The rocket lands safely back on Earth. All of Kaka's friends wait with a big party. Balloons, cake, and cheers fill the air.
Congratulations, young astronaut! You completed all fifty levels! You are a true typing champion! Kaka is so proud of you. The greatest adventure was the one we shared together. Until next time!`
